I created this 3D renderer using C++, DirectX, and HLSL in 2023 as part of a school project. This is the alpha version of the renderer in the state I first created it.

This project makes use of a free-use 3rd party library called Gateware, developed and provided by professors at Full Sail University.

Build with cmake using "cmake -S ./ -B ./build"
